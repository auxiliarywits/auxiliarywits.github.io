Hi!<br/>
This is a personal blog for my personal writings, mostly reworking of my Twitter thread and notes.<br/>
<br/>
Writing is harder than I expected. My posts are disjointed rambling and decidedly incomplete. It is my attempt to articulate my observations and rough, half-assed analysis into something accessible and readable in linear fashion. <br/>
<br/>
If you're a friend of mine from Twitter, welcome. Basically my talking point is more or less the same with my tweets but it will be more elaborated.<br/>
Cheers!<br/>
