Hi!<br/>
This is a personal blog for my personal writings, mostly collection of my Twitter thread and notes. I have used several blogging website but somehow I don't have a sense of ownership over my writings.<br/>
<br/>
Warning, my posts are disjointed rambling and decidedly incomplete. It is my attempt to articulate my observations and rough, half-assed analysis into something accessible and readable in linear fashion. <br/>
<br/>
If you're a friend of mine from Twitter, welcome. Basically my talking point is more or less the same with my tweets but it will be more elaborated.<br/>
Cheers!<br/>
