Competence Porn

The Martian (2015) is a story about an astronaut that has been stranded on Mars. Mark Watney, alone and disconnected from Earth, had to find out how to stay alive using the leftover equipment. To prolong his food supply, Mark improvised his way to grow potatoes on Mars. The barren Martian soil was fertilized with the leftover excrement from his crew member. A watering device was crafted from a controlled burn of rocket fuel. To keep the moisture level high, he set up a plastic screen as a greenhouse.

This is a movie where a huge part of the joy is just watching him explain his thought process. From identifying the situation, pondering the problems, calculating the resources, and planning the next step. It is very satisfying as if we’re involved in the process.

In Ocean Eleven (2001), Danny Ocean persuades a group of people with different skill sets to pull a risky and almost impossible heist. It is a very stylish movie where the charm lies in scheming and bantering with each other. Danny lays out the plan, highlights the key players, explains where their skills are needed, and talks about the obstacles. Even in the middle of high-stakes execution, they still casually banter with each other, which becomes the humor of the movie. Why this kind of movie is so fun to watch?

There’s actually a term for this. A TV writer in 2009 once discussed how viewers found pleasure in watching skilled individuals engaging in witty exchanges and strategic planning, a phenomenon he coined as 'competence porn’. This term then has been used loosely in TV and cinema for depicting hypercompetent people being good at their field and working their way to solving the problem.

Aesthetic of Competence

Watching competent people use their ingenuity to escape sticky situations is satisfying. Although the characters portrayed in films are often exaggerated and unrealistic, it provides us with something we may never achieve but can aspire to be.

But there’s more than the display of capability. These characters have a certain charm and behavior that make them seem even more competent. Their assertiveness and eloquence, and the way they articulate their thoughts and engage in discourse, further contribute to their allure. 

Personalities also play a significant role in enhancing their charm. Mark Watney's unwavering optimism, Sherlock Holmes' idiosyncratic eccentricity, or Danny Ocean's nonchalant demeanor—each attribute adds depth and complexity, elevating their perceived competence.

As human beings, we always make snap judgments to estimate others’ trustworthiness and capability. Since it is impossible to assess proficiency by appearance alone, we rely on subtle cues and signals as proxies for competence. We observe the way people present themselves, their manner of speech, and their overall demeanor. I refer to this as the aesthetic of competence—a subjective evaluation of visual and behavioral cues that we associate with a person's expertise.

Weaponizing aesthetic as perceived competence
---
The aesthetic of competence is our idea and perception of what smart and capable people suppose to look like. This is shaped by our firsthand experiences working alongside them or their portrayal in popular media and movies.

If you can reverse-engineer the subtle signals and wear them, you can bypass people's guard and earn their trust. This is a double-edged sword and fraudsters are the best at exploiting them.

Fraudsters and con artists wield a deep understanding of the aesthetic of competence as a weapon of deception. They take advantage of the natural tendency to trust based on appearances by carefully creating an image that portrays intelligence, competence, and reliability. These individuals often pretend as competent figures, employing all the cues and signals we have come to associate with credibility.

Catch Me if You Can (2002) is a perfect movie to showcase the art of deception through imitation. Frank Abagnale with his impersonation skill confidently outsmarts the public and authorities. Along the way, he has become a teacher, a doctor, a pilot even a secret service. Until the real problem arises, people didn’t bother to check his credibility because he displays the correct aesthetic coding of each profession.

Elizabeth Holmes, the ex-president of Theranos, is a highly controversial figure due to her fraudulent activities in her blood-testing startup. 
Initially regarded as "The Next Steve Jobs," Holmes mimicked Jobs' style by adopting an all-black wardrobe, wearing turtlenecks, and speaking like him. She even attempted to deepen her voice to further resemble Steve Jobs. The decision to invent a persona for herself is a response to her experience of not being taken seriously during pitching sessions. As silly as it sounds, her strategy works. People began to pay attention to her and the investors started to come in.

A lot of internet marketers carefully use certain aesthetic choices to portray themselves as cool and competent. They may wear suits to appear elite, pose with luxury items to look wealthy, smoke cigars to seem masculine, or offer life advice to be perceived as wise. All of these efforts are aimed at creating a larger-than-life persona to sell courses or membership. My advice is to be careful because the charm of the marketer may not reflect the quality of the product. Don’t fall for the persona, do your due diligence.

Resisting influence
---

To summarize, our fascination with watching skilled individuals stems from the desire to emulate their capabilities. Along the way, we unconsciously absorb the nuanced cues of their aesthetics as a measure of their competence.

However, competence can’t be invoked by adopting the aesthetic alone. At best, it allows us to enhance our persuasiveness by associating ourselves with their credibility. I know it’s supposed to be common sense, but our subconscious mind often blurs the line between facts and fiction when processing subtle elements such as stories, impressions, symbols, patterns, and intense emotions. This is where we are all vulnerable to influence.

Your media consumption seeps through your mind deeply and shapes your perception of the world. If you never work alongside the actual professional, your mind will borrow the image from popular depictions. We should be mindful of our own judgment, we can’t rely on intuition alone. Don’t be blinded by the charisma and the smooth-talking, do your due diligence.
