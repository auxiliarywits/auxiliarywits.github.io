Suppose you want to move from A to B. To get to your destination, logically, you have to reach the halfway point between A and B. Before getting to the halfway point, you must reach the halfway of the halfway point. But before even getting to that point, you also have to reach half of it, and so forth. Assuming that you have to finish every step before doing the next, this means there is an infinite step required to complete the journey. Thus, movement is impossible. This is the Zeno paradox of motion.

Zeno’s paradox starts with the premise that we need to move through all of the halfway points between the start and destination, then we have shown that any distance can be breakdown into an infinite number of halfway points. Therefore if you want to move, you have to complete reaching all infinite halfway points — thus impossible. Yet, in real life, movement is so obvious it shouldn’t be a controversy. If you want to move, just move.

I often use this paradox as an analogy to describe self-deception in procrastination. Procrastination is a habit of delaying or postponing action until the last minute despite knowing the negative consequences. We often rationalize it with stories we told ourselves that the delay was inevitable and comes from good intentions. 
One form of procrastination is deliberately overwhelming ourselves with never-ending preparation instead of start doing the actual task. Like an entrepreneur who is stuck in finding inspiration instead of trying to build a business. A student who is spending too much time reading references instead of writing and formulating his thought for the essay. A job seeker who is prepping all the time but never start applying. I think you’re familiar with the pattern.

We deceive ourselves by keep adding distance between us and the necessary work: Endless to-do lists and over-extending preparation. The standard keeps higher, the list keeps longer until we feel exhausted even before starting. Thus, it feels impossible to finish. Imagine an entrepreneur that convinced that he has to finish reading all the business books before trying it for real. A job seeker who refuses to apply for the job and chooses to do self-learning until he’s competent in every skill required. This unrealistic standard is self-imposed to avoid the actual fear of failing. From the internal perspective, it is almost impossible to finish the task. From other people’s perspectives, this is just self-sabotage.

Paradox stories are interesting because it’s able to lead people doubting the common obvious fact. If you frame a problem and reason it in a specific way, you can arrive at an unintuitive conclusion. Be careful of the sophistry of your mind. You’re capable to intellectualize and rationalize anything into a seemingly reasonable explanation — including justifying to not do the necessary work.
