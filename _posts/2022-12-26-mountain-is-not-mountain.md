There is a famous Zen saying:
>“Before I had studied Zen for thirty years, I saw mountains as mountains, and waters as waters. When I arrived at a more intimate knowledge, I came to the point where I saw that mountains are not mountains, and waters are not waters. But now that I have got its very substance I am at rest. For it's just that I see mountains once again as mountains, and waters once again as waters.”

(Alan Watts, *The Way of Zen*, New York, Pantheon Books, 1951, p. 126, 220 k)
