There is a famous Zen saying:
>“Before I had studied Zen for thirty years, I saw mountains as mountains, and waters as waters. When I arrived at a more intimate knowledge, I came to the point where I saw that mountains are not mountains, and waters are not waters. But now that I have got its very substance I am at rest. For it's just that I see mountains once again as mountains, and waters once again as waters.”

(Alan Watts, *The Way of Zen*, New York, Pantheon Books, 1951, p. 126, 220 k)

I may not have reached enlightenment (yet) but the saying reminds me of how we progress when we are learning.

A study usually involves breaking down an object of study and then putting our attention to its part. We would learn about their names, properties, behavior, and their relationship with other parts. 

In the process, we alter the way see the object. The mountain is not a mountain, it’s the sum of its part. The river is not a river, it’s the sum of its part. The object is not an object, it is the sum of its parts — which deserves its own studies. You can dissect it and analyze it with different lenses. The more you learn about it the more you question your understanding of it. Everything has a deeper meaning, everything is more complex than it seems.

But then after a while, after we gained a better understanding, we start to see the mountain as a mountain again. It’s not going back to square one, it’s looking with fresh eyes. Your extensive knowledge of mountains will not distract you from enjoying the beautiful view because it has seeped into your mind. This casual and relaxed attitude of a seasoned person is almost indistinguishable from the beginner.
