There is a famous Zen saying:
>“Before I had studied Zen for thirty years, I saw mountains as mountains, and waters as waters. When I arrived at a more intimate knowledge, I came to the point where I saw that mountains are not mountains, and waters are not waters. But now that I have got its very substance I am at rest. For it's just that I see mountains once again as mountains, and waters once again as waters.”

(Alan Watts, *The Way of Zen*, New York, Pantheon Books, 1951, p. 126, 220 k)

I may not have reached enlightenment (yet) but the saying reminds me of how we progress when we are learning. A study usually involves breaking down an object of study and then putting our attention to its part. We would learn about their names, properties, behavior, and their relationship with other parts. 

In the process, we alter the way see the object. The mountain is not a mountain, it’s the sum of its part. The river is not a river, it’s the sum of its part. The object is not an object, it is the sum of its parts — which deserves its own studies. You can dissect it and analyze it with different lenses. As you delve deeper into the subject, you will question your understanding more and more. Often, the more you learn about something, the more you realize that there are multiple layers of meaning and complexity beneath the surface. You may find that even simple questions become difficult to answer. For example, when asked 'What is a mountain?' you may find yourself responding with something like “I'm not sure, it depends.”

As our understanding improves over time, we may begin to view the mountain as a mountain once again. However, this shift in perspective is not a return to the starting point; rather, it's about approaching the situation with a renewed sense of clarity and appreciation. Your extensive knowledge of mountains will not distract you from enjoying the beautiful view because it has seeped into your mind. This casual and relaxed attitude of a seasoned individual is often difficult to distinguish from that of a beginner.
