Writing is hard, harder than I thought.
^
I want to blame social media for my poor writing skills but I don’t think it’s fair because maybe I’m not that good in the first place. When I decided to create this blog and start writing longer than a Twitter thread, I’m struggling to build a coherent paragraph. I know what I want to write and I can communicate it verbally (my friends have to endure my blabbering) but I'm struggling to write it down without sounding like a high school essay.

Twitter definitely plays a big role in shaping how I express my thought. I’m used to writing in tweets, one chunk at a time. The Twitter thread allows me to articulate my thoughts in a chain of bullet points. But that's it. When I tried to expand it into a long form, it feels janky and disconnected.

My initial observation of myself when I'm trying to write:
- I find myself switching between Indonesian and English as I am composing this message, as certain ideas and concepts can be more clearly conveyed in one language over the other.
- My thought process is not exactly in sequence order, as I frequently jump between concepts and make connections between them in a non-linear fashion. I only became aware that my thought process was confusing when I tried to put it into writing.
- I find that I struggle to express myself effectively because my vocabulary is limited. This often leads me to rely on a repetitive set of words, which can make my writing or speaking feel dry.

I am working to develop my writing skills so that I am able to clearly and logically convey my thoughts and ideas in a way that is easy for others to understand. Honestly, it feels like learning to ride a bike, it feels awkward but I'm getting the hang of it over time.
